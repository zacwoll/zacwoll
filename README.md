# About Me

## Introduction

👋 Hey there! I'm Zac, a Full Stack software engineer who loves problem-solving and learning new things. Coming from a non-traditional background, I tackle challenges with creativity and adaptability, and I thrive in collaborative environments. 💡💻🤝

## Education and Experience

I honed my communication and collaboration skills while slinging lattes at Starbucks before diving headfirst into web development at Holberton School. Now, I love building web applications using a variety of languages and technologies, but TypeScript is my jam! It's just so fun to debug! 📚☕️👨‍💻🚀

## Hobbies and Interests

When I'm not coding, you can find me rock climbing 🧗‍♂️, practicing yoga 🧘‍♂️, listening to vinyl 🎶, or shredding on my guitar 🎸.

## Conclusion

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow, both personally and professionally. If you want to talk tech or just chat about music, feel free to connect with me. 🤙
