### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Zac, I am a Web Developer! I've had the pleasure of attending Holberton School for the last ~2 years and now I'm graduating and available for hire! Please look through my repositories and tell me what you think! I mostly focus on JavaScript these days because I enjoy working with Node, Express, FrontEnd JavaScript, libraries like React. I think TypeScript is the bee's knees and I'm aiming to write my projects in it going forward. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Autodidact](https://github.com/zacwoll/Autodidact)
